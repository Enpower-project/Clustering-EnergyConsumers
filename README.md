#Energy Consumption Clustering Analysis in London Households

##Overview
This repository hosts the code and methodology used in my thesis project, which focuses on the analysis of energy consumption patterns in 5,000 London households. The project aims to explore novel feature extraction techniques and evaluate their effectiveness in identifying distinct consumption patterns.

##Data Set
The analysis is based on a dataset of energy consumption from London households. [Dataset Link]

##Feature Extraction
We experimented with unique feature extraction methods that are less common in existing literature, aiming to uncover new patterns in energy consumption.

##Clustering Algorithms and Validity Indexes
Multiple clustering algorithms were tested, including K-Means++, Fuzzy C-means, etc. Their performance was evaluated based on four clustering validity indexes to ensure robustness in the results.

##Cluster Analysis
The final part of the analysis involved applying K-Means++ clustering to identify 6 distinct clusters, providing insights into the varying energy consumption patterns among the households.
